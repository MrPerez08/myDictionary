Im still trying to figure out how I want to organize words, and the collections of words;
I understand that a single word can be an adjective, noun, verb, blah blah blah,
sometimes the way the word is written stays the same dispite being its verb counter part for example,
they also have their tenses, suffixes, and prefixes.

I want to give each word a list of example use cases,
give every useful aspect to the user but at the moment im unsure how.


deck class
  wordList <- the list of words of type "word"
  time <- the date and time the deck was synthesized
  description <- give a short description to your deck

  abilities to merge decks??


word class
  word <- the word
  variable <- bigahh list with embedded lists?? 
    for the word "Set":
      [["verb",[put, lay, or stand (something) in a specified place or position,"Dana set the mug of tea down"],
        [be situated or fixed in a specified place or position.,"the village was set among olive groves on a hill"]],
      ["noun",[a group or collection of things that belong together or resemble one another or are usually found together.],["a set of false teeth"]]]
