Quizlet import aid (converts the two text documents into a single document that will allow you to easily copy paste the text for easy imported flashcards)
Discover a more organized way to compartmentalize components of a word (the definitions text document at the moment contains the "kind" of word it is (adjective, verb, noun) the definition itself, and an example of how its usewd properly)
Develop a UI 
How to get an AI model (possibly utilizing Gemini API) to generate the definitions for the user



if word is a subset of the vocab word (the word is contained in vocabword) then it is considered a composition and an object should be created




checks to make sure compositions of compositions are branches of the composition and should NOT be duplicated for both the vocab word and the 
composition for example the word unity, unit and uni, all three share very different definitions AND uni is contained IN Unit and Unit is contained in Unity so 
uni should NOT be contained in Unity? should we do that to reduce redundancies?????? or what YES make a list of tuples with one list being the list of objects and
the second list holding the strings
