Lemma / Lexeme: The base dictionary form of the word (e.g., "use").


Inflection: The process of changing the form of a word to express different grammatical categories like:
Tense (for verbs: use, uses, using, used)
Number (for nouns: use, uses; for verbs: use vs. uses in 3rd person singular)
Person (for verbs: I use, he uses)
Case (more prominent in languages like Latin or German, e.g., he/him/his)
Gender (in some languages)
Degree (for adjectives/adverbs: big, bigger, biggest)
Inflected Forms: The resulting different forms of the word created by inflection (e.g., uses, using, used).


Specifically for Verbs:
The set of inflected forms showing tense, person, number, aspect, etc., is called its Conjugation.
So, the list "use, uses, using, used" is the conjugation of the verb "use" (in its primary forms).


What it's NOT:
Derivation: Creating a new word with a different meaning or part of speech by adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., use -> usable, user, reuse, usage). These are different lexemes/words.
Homonyms: Different words that happen to be spelled/sounded the same (e.g., "bank" - river vs. money).
Therefore, when you ask for "use, uses, using, used", you are asking for the inflected forms (specifically the conjugation) of the verb "use".


Here are the main inflected forms for the verb "use":
Base Form / Infinitive: use
3rd Person Singular Present: uses
Present Participle / Gerund: using
Simple Past Tense: used
Past Participle: used
