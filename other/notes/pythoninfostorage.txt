Lists
Tuples
Tuples (collections module)
Dictionaries
Sets
Arrays (arraymodule)
Arrays (numPy)
Strings
Bytearray
Deque



Choosing the Right Structure:
Lists: General purpose, mutable sequences
Tuples: Immutable sequences (for fixed data)
Dictionaries: Key-value mappings
Sets: Unique element collections
Arrays/NumPy arrays: Numerical data processing
Deque: When you need fast appends/pops at both ends
Named tuples: When you need tuple immutability with named fields
